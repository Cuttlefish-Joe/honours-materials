HugeGlaciers looks at loading the timing files for large glacier movement (can be downloaded online from the source in thesis references) and comparing them to the PIG events. 

MappingMapTrial is just creating the initial PIG map as well as an (unused) equivalent for Thwaites.

Neat_bulk_plots_for_thesis is generating the distance-azimuth plots used in LF analysis. 

PIG_Main is where a lot of the on-glacier HF analysis is done; it is rather long as a warning. 

PIG_events is a narrowed-down catalogue of PIG GEQ.

Suitable_Satellites_PIG was for determining which events got investigated by satellite. 

coolfunctions contains some functions which may be used in the notebooks. 

longthin is generating the other LF analysis figures.

relative_relocations_final is about the relative relocation of events. 

wave_arrivals is about creating the first LF figure, comparing the GEQ to the Singeleton event. 

I haven't included the precursor analysis notebooks here, as they are uploaded to Ceres and rather large (making it a difficult time for me to transfer them between locations).
